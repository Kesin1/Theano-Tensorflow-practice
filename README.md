# Theano-Thensorflow-practice
Examples of ML-Problems solved with Theano resp. Tensorflow
(and a training for me using Github)

These examples and their solutions are very much inspired by solutions of Lazyprogrammer Inc. Instructor at Udemy 
where I have taken many courses on the subject of machine learning.

Though I can honestly say that I wrote them myself, there are a lot of similarities like structure and a lot of formulations 
since they seemed to me the most effecient and I took some looks at the solutions as well when I got stucked or I wanted to compare the solutions.
